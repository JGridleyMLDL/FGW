# FGW

Python implementation of the paper [Optimal Transport for structured data with application on graphs
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09114) 

In the paper we also used this implementation of [PSCN](https://github.com/tvayer/PSCN)

### Prerequisites

*

### Data 

All the data used in the paper came from the Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels [3]

### What is included ?


### What will be added ?

* k-means of multiple graphs will be added soon
* The Integration in the POT library [1] of the function for calculating fgw
